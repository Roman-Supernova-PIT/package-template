Roman Supernova PIT Packaging Guide
===================================

The `Roman Supernova PIT Python Packaging Guide <https://Roman-Supernova-PIT.github.io/package-template/>`__ is based on the OpenAstronomy package template and contains an embedded `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/>`__ template.


Using the Template
==================

With this template and guide is a `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/>`__ template which allows you to get started quickly with a package as described in this guide.

To create a new package based on the template run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install cookiecutter cruft
   $ cruft create https://github.com/Roman-Supernova-PIT/package-template

It will ask you several questions:

* *Select your package name* : This is the name your package will have on PyPi, and ``pip install <packagename>`` will be the command that somebody types in order to install it.  (It will also be the name of the directory that gets created, ready for you to start putting code into.)
* *Select your module name* : This is the name of the module.  To use your package in python, you will do ``import <modulename>``.  Ideally your module name is the same as your package name, and that's what it defaults to.  Making the two the same makes things simpler for everybody.  However, you may want to prefix your package (but not module) name with ``roman_snpit_``.  You may need to do this if your module name is too close to something that already exists on PyPi.
* *Name of repo on github underneath Roman-Supernova-PIT* : Your github repo will be at ``https://github.com/Roman-Supernova-PIT/<reponame>``.  Ideally, this is the same as your module name, and that's what it defaults to.
* *Short description of your package* : one-line description of your package.  Don't keep the default here, put something specific to your package in.
* *Author Name* : If you are mostly writing this yourself, put your own name in.  Otherwise, put in Roman Supernova PIT.
* *Author Email* : This is a contact person for this package.  Hopefully it will never get used, but somebody might need to ask about it.  Put the email of the person who should receive those questions here.
* *GitHub username* : Your github username, or the github username of the person who will be the primary owner of this package.
* *Select minimum python version* : Select 1 for 3.11 here if that's at all possible, as that's the environment we're using for the SN PIT.  Only pick a higher version if you *really* need it.
* *...non-python code that compiles*: If you've only written Python, leave this at 'n'.  If you have compiled extensions (e.g. C++ code that you link to Ptyhon with ``ctypes``), answer 'y' here.
* *include example code* : This option will fill your new package with some example functions to allow you to test it.  It defaults to 'y'.  Remember to remove the example code later if you don't really want it to be part of your package.
* *Include github workflow testing...* : Answer 'y' (the default) to include github workflows that will instruct github to automatically run tests on any pull request to your repo.  You probably want to leave this at 'y'.
* *install_requires* : Here you can list additional external packages that your package requires.  Don't worry if you miss some here, you will be able to add to that list later by editing a file the package template creates.

Cruft is built on cookiecutter, and enables the updating of the template from the source.
This takes the form of pull requests to the repository that the new package is pushed to.
If a package already has a cookiecutter template, it can be linked to the parent repository using ``cruft link url-to-template``.

To manually check whether the current environment matches with the template then ``cruft check`` will tell you what the current status is.
``cruft update`` will manually trigger an updating of the package to the template.

If you would like to stick to simply the cookiecutter approach, the template still supports that functionality thusly:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install cookiecutter
   $ cookiecutter gh:Roman-Supernova-PIT/package-template -o ./output_directory

This will create a new directory in your current directory named the same as the value of "packagename" you supplied. Change into this directory and run ``git init`` to make it into a git repository, and make an initial commit. Then pip install into a clean environment and try building docs:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd <your package name>
   $ git init -b main
   $ pip install -e ".[docs,test]"
   $ cd docs
   $ make html


This is required in order to have software versioning working for your package, and to test creating docs.

The goal of the template is to quickly get you setup with the files described in the guide.

When ``git add``ing files to your repo
--------------------------------------
You want to add everything created by the package template, and you probably want to do that the first time before you start adding your own files and customizing it.  However, if you created your clean environment in such a way that it created a new directory in your package directory, make sure *not* to import that environment into git!  (This will happen, for instance, if you run ``python -mvenv clean_environment``.  It will create a directory ``clean_environment`` under your current directory, which will end up with a lot of stuff you really don't want to track in git.)  As long as you didn't do that, you can probably just run ``git add .`` and trust the ``.gitignore`` file to not add most of the stuff you don't want.

Adapting an existing package to the package template
====================================================

(This procedure was written by Rob Knop.  If you are confused about it, are (quite rationally) afraid of it, or want help with it, ping him on the SNPIT slack.)

If you already have a git repository and want to update it to use the Roman SN PIT template, some additional work is involved.  Suppose that your existing repo is named ``existing_repo``, and that you have a checkout in your current directory with that same name.

**Before you start**: do two things.  First, make sure everything in your current repo is committed and pushed.  That way, if you screw something up, you can always start over by cloning your repo back from github.  This is a fiddly enough process that screwing something up is distressingly likely.  I also recommend doing this all on a new branch of your repo, which you can merge back to ``main`` when you're done.

Second, make sure you understand the file structure and directory layout of a package created from the package template.  Read the documentation on the package template, in partciular the "Minimal package layout" section.  (TODO: link to docs.)

Once you're ready to go, start in the directory that is the parent of where your existing repo is checked out.  (I.e. the directory in which you would do ``cd existing_repo`` in order to get to your checkout.)  Run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install cookiecutter cruft
   $ cruft create https://github.com/Roman-Supernova-PIT/package-template --output-dir existing_repo_template

replacing ``existing_repo`` with the name of your package.  Notice that you are *not* creating the template in the same diredctory, but a new directory with ``_template`` appended to the end.  When asked for your package and module name, give it the name of your existing repo (``existing_repo`` in this example); the package name is what it will be called on PyPi, and the module name is the thing you ``import`` in python.  Often, but not always, these are the same.  See below for answering the other various questions to you get.  Running this ``cruft`` command will create a directory ``existing_repo_template``, which in turn has a subdirectory ``existing_repo`` (again, as always, replacing ``existing_repo`` with the name of your package).

Next, some hand work is going to be required to make sure things are all in the right format.  In your existing repo do the following:

* If it's not there already, move (using ``git mv``) all the code that comprises the content of your package into a subdirectory with *module name* as the repo (``existing_repo`` in this exampleâ€” so, your code would now be in ``existing_repo/existing_repo`` relative to the directory where you clone stuff from github).

* In this subdirectory, if you have a file ``__init__.py``, rename it to ``__init__.py-BACKUP``.  (Don't do this with ``git mv``, just do a standard ``mv``.  Yes, you're making a mess out of your checkout, but you'll clean it up later.)

* If you have tests, make sure they are all in the ``existing_repo/tests`` subdirectory of your checkout.  (So, ``existing_repo/existing_repo/tests`` relative to the parent directory where you do your git clones.)  Again, if they're not already in the right place, move them with ``git mv``.

* In the ``tests`` subdirectory, if you have any of the following files, rename them to ``<filename>-BACKUP`` (again just with ``mv``, *not* with ``git mv``).
  * ``conftest.py``
  * ``__init__.py``

* ``cd`` back to the top level directory of your checkout (in this example, ``existing_repo`` underneath the directory where you run ``git clone``).

* Try running::
    rsync -n -a -v -i ../existing_repo_template/existing_repo/ ./

  as always replacing ``existing_repo`` with the name of your own repo.  This will not actually copy any files; the ``-n`` makes it a dry run.  This will tell you what will get copied from the package template to your current directory.  The output is a little bit byzantine, but the key is to look for lines that do *not* start with either ``.d..t......`` (which just indicates a directory), or ``>f+++++++++``.  Lines that start with the latter describe a file that does not exist in your current directory and that will be copied over from the template.  This is all good!  If there are any other lines that start with ``>f`` but do *not* have the row of plusses, then those are files that already exist in your current directory that will be overwritten when you import the template.  If you really know what you're doing, you can just let this happen.  However, what you should probably do instead is rename that file from ``<filename>`` to ``<filename>-BACKUP`` so that you're current changes won't get overwritten.  (You will merge this later.)  When you've done this, run the above ``rsync`` command again to make sure everything in the output is either a directory, something you are very confident you want to overwrite, or something that starts with ``>f+++++++++``.

* Once you're confident you're not going to overwrite anything you don't want to, run::
    rsync -a -v -i ../existing_repo_template/existing_repl/ ./

  this actually *will* copy over files.

* Run the following command::
    find . -name "*-BACKUP" -print

  for every file listed in that command, you need to merge that file with the same file that does not have the ``-BACKUP` in the filename.  Do this manually, and carefully.  It might be painful.  I hope not.  The results of the merge should go into the file without ``-BACKUP`` in the name.  When you're done, delete the ``-BACKUP`` file.

* Do a ``git status`` in the top level of your repo.  You should see lots of files that were added by importing the template.  You will also see moved and modified files.  ``git add`` the appropriate files, ``git commit``, and ``git push``.
